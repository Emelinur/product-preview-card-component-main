![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)
## Welcome! üëã
This is my solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa).

I had built this project before, but this time I updated it with **style guide tokens (colors, typography, spacing)**, **semantic HTML**, and **responsive clamp-based scaling**.

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic **HTML5**  
- **CSS custom properties** (style guide tokens)  
- **CSS Grid** + Flexbox  
- **clamp()** for fluid typography & spacing  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Accessible markup (`button`, `alt`, `focus-visible`)  

### What I learned
I practiced updating an old project using a **design system approach**.  
- Created tokens for **colors, spacing, typography**.  
- Used `clamp()` to make font sizes and spacing responsive without many media queries.  
- Learned the difference between **vh** and **svh**:  
  - `vh` = viewport height (can jump on mobile when browser UI shows/hides).  
  - `svh` = ‚Äúsmall viewport height‚Äù, more stable on mobile.  

Example of a fluid spacing token:
```css
--space-200: clamp(1rem, 0.8rem + 1vw, 1.5rem);
 ```
